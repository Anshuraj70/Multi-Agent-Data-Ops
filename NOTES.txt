Notes from the stage of writing HOME page.tsx linking with
api\generate and building UI => search-button.
1. page.tsx can't be async and use useState — Server Components can't have hooks
2. useFormStatus() only works with Server Actions, not fetch API calls
3. Missing onChange handler for the textarea
In Next.js (and in the browser in general), when you do "const response = await fetch(url);" the 
returned Response object has a built-in property called .ok. response.ok is true if the HTTP status code is in the range 200–299, otherwise false.
e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement> ===> "e is a React FormEvent generated by an HTML <form> element."

use client => is a directive that you put at the top of a file, and it tells Next.js / React 
that this file (and all its components) should be treated as a client component — 
i.e., it will be rendered (and hydrated) in the browser, not just on the server.
Why Use "use client"?
- We need `useState` and event handlers (like `onChange`, `onSubmit`)
- These React features only work in Client Components
- Server Components can't have interactivity
1. Interactivity
If your component needs React state (useState), side effects (useEffect), event handlers (onClick, onChange), or any browser-specific APIs (window, localStorage, etc.), you need it to run on the client. Server components can't use these. 
2. Boundary Definition
The directive defines a client-server boundary. Once a file is marked as client, everything imported into it (child components, modules) is considered part of the client bundle. 
3. Optimisation
Because by default, components in the app directory are server components, you should only mark files as client when necessary — this helps reduce the JavaScript bundle size sent to the browser. 
Where to Use It ?

Put it as the first line in a file (before any imports). 
Typically in UI components or “interactive islands” — for example, a counter, form, button, modal — that need client-side behavior. 
You don’t need to add "use client" to every file that uses client logic — only at the entry points.

### 2. **Why not use `useFormStatus()`?**
- `useFormStatus()` only works with **Server Actions** (functions marked with `"use server"`)
- We're using a **fetch API call** to a **Route Handler** instead
- For Route Handlers, we manage loading state manually with `useState`
